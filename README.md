Interactive teaching during COVID-19


## Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted teaching and learning at all levels, particularly affecting practical and mathematical subjects like Computer Science. Engaging students and obtaining feedback became challenging due to the lack of physical interaction and students' hesitation to participate in online forums. This paper shares the experience, results, and effectiveness of using topic-specific polls at the start and end of online classes. These polls, with the same type of questions, helped gauge lesson effectiveness, and student understanding and provided insights for future lessons. The paper also discusses different levels of question design, student engagement, and poll design parameters.
